# Adaptive Traffic Control System

This project addresses the chronic traffic congestion problem in Sri Lanka's urban areas by developing an intelligent traffic management system. Our solution leverages real-time weather and traffic data to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings, optimizing traffic flow and reducing the need for manual intervention by traffic police.

## Problem Definition

Traffic congestion in Sri Lanka results in delays, increased fuel consumption, and necessitates traffic police deployment at busy intersections. Traditional pre-programmed traffic light systems fail to adapt to real-time traffic and weather conditions, leading to inefficiencies and extended travel times. Our project aims to mitigate these issues through a smart, adaptive traffic light system.

## Project Background

This project was developed as part of the SLIoT competition, where we aimed to revolutionize traffic management in Sri Lanka using cutting-edge technology. The competition provided a platform to innovate and create a real-world solution.

## Proposed Solution

### Components

- **IoT Sensors**: Monitor traffic flow, detect vehicles, and assess environmental conditions.
- **Centralized Control System**: Employs a sophisticated traffic control algorithm for real-time analysis and adaptation.
- **Smart Traffic Lights**: Adjust dynamically based on real-time data from the control system.
- **Mobile App**: Offers real-time traffic updates, alternative route suggestions, and a feedback mechanism for users.

### Unique Features

- Real-Time Adaptability
- IoT Integration and Connectivity
- Predictive Traffic Analysis with AI
- Citizen Empowerment via Mobile App
